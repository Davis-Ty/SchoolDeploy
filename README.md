# HTML
- This HTML document includes JavaScript code to generate an interactive flight map. It utilizes D3.js for data visualization and manipulation. The script loads geographical data for U.S. states and major airports using TopoJSON. It then renders the map with state and airport elements and animates flights between airport pairs using SVG paths and transitions. The flight animation loop is controlled by setInterval.

# JS

- The routes variable contains an array of flight routes between different airports, represented as pairs of airport codes. Each pair indicates a flight route from the first airport to the second airport. For example, ['LAS', 'MSY'] represents a flight route from Las Vegas (LAS) to New Orleans (MSY).

- The data appears to be structured as an array of arrays, with each inner array representing a flight route. There are numerous flight routes listed in the array, indicating various connections between airports.
